# Pipeline extension manager
This project is in two parts:
1. The chrome extension
2. The python indexing script


If you wish to install the chrome extension, please go inside the misc/chrome_extension folder and read the instructions.


The python indexing script is to add the extension of a git user to the coveo-labs extension gallery, thus someone using the chrome extension should never worry about it.
